Software Engineering Project - Spring 2016

With the advent of social media, people spend a lot of time browsing the web and tend to share any interesting facts with their near and dear ones. However the ease with which you can share a snippet of the screen has not evolved as much. There are quite a few insipid approaches taken to solve the issue of sharing a snippet of a web page in the form of images on any social media. Our traditional way
of taking a screenshot constitutes multiple steps and saving these screen shots on our local machine takes away unnecessary memory of our machines. We are looking at an innovative approach of solving this problem by reducing clutter and cumbersome task of taking screen-shots, cutting and sharing.

The problem with sharing the a specific snippet of a screenshots with any of the social media across platforms has its way of causing inconvenience by involving multiple steps, taking up unnecessary space on the device and locating the saved image on the machine for uploading. The usual layman’s way is to use ’PrtScr’ or a desktop application to grab images and finally save them on our system. Following this, is the task of cutting, uploading the image using the upload button. Somewhat loosely, these steps of capture, save/edit and share are holy trinity of sharing the screen shots across platforms. We have performed an extensive study to identify
the drawbacks of this usual approach. We conducted a survey and with considerate amount of observation to understand and identify how people get around this task. Our video recordings, interviews and surveys have targeted the audience with questions which subtly reveal the issues faced by them. The metrics indicate that a wide section of the people consider asking for a simple new way overcoming the
drawbacks. Although a sparse population is aware of screenshot applications, not many use it due to the fact that it requires saving those files onto the local system. The good news is, we are on the way to implement a simple way of sharing only a specific section of a web page which would save a considerable amount of time and space. Learning to live with a problem is not the way of a engineer’s life and we are committed to finding an easier solution to this.

#Telemetry:
The server keeps track of the usage and solutions being used across by users. We can mine the data from this to determine trends and usage patterns of the solutions.
